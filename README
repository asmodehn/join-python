Join Python: Join-calculus for Python

Extensions to join-calculus:

	concurrently(f...) runs a set of functions concurrently
	and joins with all of them.

	Signals have join() which joins with the signal and
	returns its return (signals do not need to be void.)

	The return of fragments are returned when fetching.
